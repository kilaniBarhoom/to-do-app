# To Do List App

In this project I have created a Simple yet effective ToDo list website that allows the user to add, delete, edit, hide and even sort the tasks.Was created with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the LocalStorage.

### Utilities & Features

      The website is designed in a responsive design way to deal with all screen sizes and types.
  
- Hide / Show Task
  - User can hide selected tasks to hide it from other users that access the same website.
  - user can Show the hidden tasks
  
- Hosting

    The Website is lanched to Github and Netlify to be viewed and used.
    
- Track Changes

     Website's changes are being tracked using Git and GitHib.

     You can mark the task as completed or non-complete. The completed tasks will light up green to be visualised as completed.
